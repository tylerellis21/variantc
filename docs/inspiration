# Everything is not an object

At the lowest level what do we have? Memory, Bytes, Bits...

We are manipulating memory, preforming operations on that memory.
Moving and manipulating memory is the core task we face.

How we interpret that memory is up to the program.

That's why everything can't be an object.
Because at the lowest level we have bits and bytes... which are not objects...

A type is nothing more than an interpretation of said bytes or an abstract concept represented by said type (@Tyler: Wording)

We write instructions to operate on said types.
    Preform math operations
    load/store into said memory (array of bytes)
