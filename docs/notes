# Notes

"Inside C++, there is a MUCH SMALLER AND CLEANER LANGUAGE struggling to get out"
    - B. Stroustrup.

One syntax for everything!
    Compile time settings.
    preprocessing/compile time execution.

Do we have to use stack unwinding for try/catch?

What if we had "catch trees"?

move vs copy vs initalize

"constructor" functions?

Bounds Checking

Type Safe

Initalization

Interop support for C and C++ will be very important.
A lot of libraries are built with C, so we will NEED to interface with them at some point.

What is the quickest way to get the language up and working.

So we can start building the standard library and game engine libraries.

Well we need the lexer, parser, IR and C/C++ generators working and or ASM generator.

It would be very nice to have some basic semantic validation.

If all we achive is c++ without having to write headers, I would be fine with that.
