utf8 rawLiteral = !`
hello world\nthis\t
is a raw \t literal
`;

// Here the \n and \t will not be escaped by the compiler
// The new lines are also included in the raw literal.
// used a @prefix to prevent new lines from being included in the string.

// Use the standard quoted string literals instead if you want to use escape sequences in a string.
// eg: utf8 example = "hello\nworld\tTheses will be escaped by the compiler and replaced as needed"
